  Sections
  #

In section, we split the class into smaller groups to review material,
discuss, and complete exercises.  Sections generally occur on a weekly
basis; for details, see the schedule.
Here’s some of what past students said they liked about sections:


&quot;I really liked the sections - I found them really useful and tended to learn a lot within them.&quot;
&quot;I know [sections] were new this year, so I really think you should keep them as a part of the course because they were very helpful for having a smaller setting to ask questions and solidify my understanding of concepts.&quot;
&quot;I found section super super helpful as it was a chance to talk to both TAs and other students in the class and ask more specific questions.&quot;
&quot;[Sections] were extremely helpful for understanding concepts that I didn't understand initially in lecture due to the smaller groups in section. I had more opportunities to raise my hand and discuss with others.&quot;

</h5><p>Here’s how sections in CS 300 work:</p><ul><li>Every student will attend eight mandatory sections over the course
of the semester (roughly weekly, with some breaks and exceptions for
quiz review weeks). The sections will be lead by the professor or a
team of TAs and are designed to provide a space for you to review and
reinforce lecture material, and for you to ask questions about the
material.</li><li>A section will consist of 20-25 students who will stay within the
same section grouping all semester.</li><li>At the start of the semester, you will sign up for a section
on CAB when you enroll in the course (or as part of Lab 0).</li><li>When your section takes place, your attendance is <b>required</b>.
We expect you to attend, be prepared, ask questions and contribute
to the discussion. The section instructors will take attendance during
the section.</li><li>Each section is centered around one or two concepts or
demonstration programs. We want you to participate actively
in the section, and section instructors may call on you to share your
questions and ideas.</li></ul><p>Sections are <em>not</em> gear-ups or TA hours. They serve to review
material, have it explained again in different words, and to address
your conceptual questions.</p>
